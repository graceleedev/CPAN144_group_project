Title:
BistroTable

Description:
BistroTable is a restaurant reservation web app designed to simplify the process of booking a table online. Inspired by platforms like OpenTable, it allows users to browse restaurants, check reviews and ratings, and make reservations seamlessly. 


Problem Statement:

Reservation Form: Enable users to select a date, time, and party size for their reservation with live input validation and confirmation alerts.
Data Storage: Store reservation details temporarily using localStorage and pass data between pages using Next.js routing.
Location API Integration: Embed Google Maps on restaurant detail pages to show the exact location and improve user trust and navigation.
